  You don't think that you are not floating in nothing.

Limbo~
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

The Black Hall~
     You stand in the middle of a large, round chamber, vaulted high with
black stone supports.  The chamber is crafted from polished black marble,
glittering with the dim light that emanates from torches, spaced about the
room at even intervals.  Platinum inlays line the chamber's vaulted ceilings.
In the middle of the chamber, there sits a large, oaken table, about which
are chiselled into the stone a number of black marble chairs, each decorated
according to rank and with a small gold plaque, reading the name to whom
the seat belongs.

A Shrine to a Nameless God~
  Sunlight pours through the overhanging trees, making this small shrine
glow brightly.  Bushes enclose the shine in a green wall.  A small, grey
stone alter sits in the center of the shine.  A simple cross has been
craved into the stone on all four sides.  A sense of peace imminates
from this grassy shine.  A small, worn, dirt path leads south.
