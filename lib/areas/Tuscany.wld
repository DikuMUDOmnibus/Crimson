you survived the fall.  Rocks are jutting out all around you and you can't
see anything.  There is a small staircase behind the waterfall that you 
think might lead to the top.

Meeting Hall~
This hall is GIGANTIC.  The vaulted ceiling hangs some twenty-five meters
above your head.  The rows of seats are all hand-crafted and appear to be made
and decorated individually, possibly so each villager has one's own specific
seat for the meetings.  In the center of the hall, there are two statues, one
of a half-elven mage and one of a human druid.  There are sculptures lining
the walls, each individually lit by a magic flame and each set on its own
small shelf.  The windows of this hall are fantastic, both in size and in
clarity.  There are two gargoyle statues sitting on pedestals by the entryway
and there is another pair by the front of the hall, flanking a huge statue of
the goddess Mielikki.  There is a plaque suspended in mid-air between the
three statues.

just about anything you want.  Everything is displayed in precise form and
there is not a speck of dust anywhere.  The store looks much bigger on the
inside than it did on the outside.  Clearly there is a strong magical force
at work here.  There is a sign imprinted along the wall above the cashier's

with several different species of flowers in it that are clearly not native
to this climate, yet they grow large and in perfect harmony with the other
species of plantlife.  The grass is perfectly groomed as are the trees both
surrounding this area as well as those growing within the confines of the
grove.  A couple of people can be seen moving about here and WHAT'S THIS!!!??

species of birds have made their homes in the branches of the wonderfully
manicured trees that are scattered strategically throughout the grove.  You
can see clearly now that who wander about do not do so aimlessly, rather they
are in a state of constant grove upkeep.  Everywhere they go they examine the
surroundings with such intricacy that you think that they do nothing else

Unable to be seen through the thick canopy of the forest before now, you are

are known the world over as having some of the steepest and most dangerous

of the forest canopy and their peaks cannot be seen through the clouds.
For a brief second you see something very large fly overhead, then it is gone.

Standing amongst a group of very large crags, where the feeling of dread is
overwhelming. The feeling is brought on mostly by the amount of blood that
surrounds this area.  It is like the crags themselves have been painted with
blood, as they are redder than stone colored.  There are huge bloodstains
all over the ground as well as the dried up remnants of former puddles
everywhere. The crags seem climbable if you dare to go on.

Top of the Peak, Outside a HUGE Cave~
You've made it!!  Standing on the top of this mountain peak the view of the
kingdom is breathtaking.  To the north, east and south you can see all the 
way to the edges of the magnificent Altat forest.  Far to the north-east you
can see a rather large clearing at the northern edge of the forest where 
there appears to be a village.  Even farther to the north you can see the 
magnificent river Cadera that flows directly into the forest.  To the north
of the village, on the river you can see a strikingly beautiful tower.  It
glows white, even from this distance, and appears as the most beautiful 
building you have ever seen.  You must make a point of examining it from a
closer viewpoint. 

After you take in the amazing view and catch your breath, reality finally
catches up with you.  You are standing outside an ENORMOUS cave-mouth.  Its
opening is easily more than fifteen meters around, and all of the rock around
it is scorched black.  You can hear some VERY heavy breathing coming from 
inside and you think that it would be wise to get the hell out of here fast!

the cavern has very large claw marks everywhere.  It appears like some big
creature carved it out of the side of the mountain with its claws.  There
are blackened bones strewn about all over the place and large patches of
dried blood as well.  The cavern is warmer than it was outside and you begin
to feel sweat forming on your brow.  Clearly this is not a safe place to

Entrance to the Tower~
You have entered the Glorious Ivory Tower, home to the finest cavaliers in
all of the land.  The arched ceilings and the walls are constructed out of
pure ivory and are decorated with the finest of gems from across the planes.
All around you can see emeralds, rubies, topazes, lapis, and diamonds
pressed right into the walls.  There are also several intricate carvings
seemingly come to life by the sculpturer's hand lining the hall.  Some of
greatest painters in the realms have contributed their talents to creating
portraits of the most famous cavaliers, which are displayed along this
entry hall.  There are some words carved into the wall here as well.

You are standing in front of the legendary Ivory Tower of Tuscany.  Legends
tell of the Cavaliers, also known as the 'Sons of the Wind', who reside
within these majestic walls.  Tales of their heroism in the battle to force
back the forces of Hell are legendary.  The tower itself stands over eight
stories tall and is a vibrant white in hue.  There is a large set of doors
here which lead into the tower and a path to the east which leads back to the

You are standing at the best place in the kingdom to see the Ivory Tower
from. It is absolutely gorgeous. It stands over eight stories tall and
is brilliantly white in hue.  There are no visible windows anywhere in the
structure of the tower.  There are large intricate carvings of some famous
cavaliers all along the sides of the tower.  There are several cavaliers
moving about around the side of the tower, but you clearly can't get there
from here as the tower is surrounded on all sides but this by a gigantic
crevice. Looking down into it you cannot see its bottom.

are the only means of transportation to and from it.  To the west you now

and you feel yourself drawn towards it.  Watch out for that gigantic crevice

The chamber has a dead musty smell to it and you wonder how long it has
been since anyone has been here.  There is one very noticeable thing in this
room, however, that is an ancient door to the south that glows bright blue
illuminating this chamber.  The door has pictures of a giant wyrm carved
into it.  The pictures depict the wyrm in combat with a party of adventurers,
and by the looks of it the dragon has clearly gotten the upper hand.

Chamber of the Gods~
Unlike anything you have ever seen this chamber is not only immaculately
clean but it is fantastically decorated.  There are carvings all over the
walls as well as sculptures and statues all throughout the chamber.  All
of them are lit by fairie fires and each seem to have been sculptured by
masters. As you look upon the carvings on the wall you are able to determine
that they tell a story.  It seems that at some point in time a wizard created
this room as a portal to the chambers of the gods.  He then went to them and
generally made a nuisance of himself.  After disposing of him, the gods tried
to destroy the portal, but were unable to break the magical force.  Apparently
the wizard's god had taken offense to his being killed and decided to put
his force into the portal to hold it open.  Knowing that this portal could
be incredibly dangerous if left open, the Finnish Gods, whose chambers had
been violated, created an artifact that would hold the portal within it.
They put such magics into it that no mortal could so much as grab the item
successfully. Following this they set about to make sure no one would
be able to get to the item, as they couldn't move the portal from this room.
They decided to put several magical doors and a magical chest in the passage
to this room and locked them with ancient magical keys.  Finally they gave
the gift of immortality to four creatures, known as the 'keepers'.  These
four creatures were each given the charge of guarding one of the ancient keys
in return for their everlasting life.

There is also a message carved into the floor, 'Ye who hath entered the
Chambers of the Gods be warned as it was with the wizard it shall be with
you. Do not dare to enter the halls of the gods lest ye suffer long and
painful retribution which shall result in yer DEATH'.

metal hall look exquisite.  What other wonders of construction will this
tower be home to?  The hall continues to the west and there is a staircase

would be worth a fortune.  You contemplate chipping off a piece but decide
that it would probably be unwise.  That and the fact that this tower is so 
well constructed that very few weapons in the realms could accomplish the
task without ruining their own enchantment.  There is a bronze hall leading

This is very ODD indeed.  The tower has been so brilliantly constructed that 
to find a trapdoor, especially one so obvious seems strange.  However, there
is no denying the beauty of the construction here.  There are two large
statues here:  one is of a powerful and heavily armored Cavalier.  He is 
dressed in a suit of full plate with a glowing longsword in one hand and
a shield with several symbols upon it:  The other is of another cavalier, 
dressed in chain mail, and armed with a scimitar.  Both statues are carved
from ivory and both radiate a powerful magical glow.  The hall continues to

point, you see an elven mage throwing a lightning bolt at a demon, then the 
next depicts a Shin-Shun monk having his head caved in by a dragon-kin.

their magnificent griffons/ the powerful rangers using the forces of the 
forest/ and the cavaliers with their incredible horses and armor.  Each
statue is a unique original and any one of them would cost half a dragon's
horde to purchase.  They all glow with fairie fires and to stare at them too
long could easily distract you from your goal.

Lord's coat of arms, in the other.  Against the eastern wall can be seen
several framed parchments, with such names as Telgar the Ranger Lord, Peacock
the Hierophant Druid, King Drenor of Tuscany, Melancholy (Archmage to His
Majesty), and many more signed upon them.  Against the western wall there are
various gold-plated weapons, all with plaques beneath them with the name of
the foe vanquished for the weapon.  There are three stuffed dragon heads
above these weapons as well, two of which are red dragons and one gigantic
head of an ancient black.  In the center of the room there are statues of a
Druid, a Blue Dragon, a Ranger Lord and the Cavalier Lord to whom this
chamber belongs.

Chamber of the Grand Cavalier Sorcerer~
You couldn't have entered a more dangerous chamber if you tried.  The chamber 
looks like a gigantic laboratory, with instruments of magical persuasion 
everywhere.  There is a very large bookcase with literally hundreds of books 
in it and none of them have names.  Against the western wall, there is a 
bright glow, coming from a gigantic tome resting on a pedestal.

Top of the Topaz Staircase~
This staircase looks quite remarkable.  Carved entirely out of topaz it shines
brighter than any other you've seen so far.  There are several illusions 
dancing about the room, which constantly change form and appearance.  At one
point, you see a heavily armored gentleman conversing with a god and at the
next moment you see him without any armor creating a swarm of meteors from
thin air.  The stairs go down from here and there is a lapis door to the
south and another to the west.

Top of the Pearl Staircase~
You are standing atop the beautiful pearl staircase.  The entire stairwell
glows and radiates a feeling of excessive magic.  The statues lining the walls
depict the most famous battles of the war with the forces of Hell.  The elven
warriors, mounted upon their magnificent griffons/ the powerful rangers
using the forces of the forest/ and the cavaliers with thier incredible
horses and armor.  Each statue is a unique original and any one of them
would cost half a dragon's horde to purchase.  They all glow with fairie
fires and to stare at them too long could easily distract you from your goal.
A pearl hallway leads away to the south.

this incredible tower.  There are several VERY LARGE spellbooks against
one of the walls and you wonder what the hell is big enough to require 
this much space and can cast spells?

Entrance to the Halls of the Gods~
You have entered the halls of the gods.  Overwhelming power radiates
everywhere. There are no fancy decorations or anything around.  All
around you is a mist that strangely resembles dew; however, it is neither
wet nor does it impare your vision at all it is just sort of there.  The
air here is the freshest you've ever inhaled and an all-encompasing
feeling of something unnatural engulfes you.  A magical voice booms out
as you enter the halls, 'Ye who hath violated the Halls of the Gods, be
warned:  All whom are not invited shall be dealt with accordingly.  The
mythos of the Kalevala are NOT pleased.'
