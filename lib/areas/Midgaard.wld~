The Dressing Room~
You are in a white walled room.  A thought enters your brain telling you to
dress here. (Type WEAR ALL to dress up if you wonder how)  There is an exit
down to the Donation Room, where you could find some useful stuff donated 
by those experienced players if you were lucky.  The south exit leads to
the reception of the Midgaard Inn, where you can rent a comfortable private
room when you decide to leave later.  The Royal Academy of CrimsonMUD, 
generally known as the MUD School, lies to the north.  Newbies are greatly
welcome to visit the Academy.

hill, tree, building and cave is represented in perfect detail.  As you
notice someone walking around the table wearing an old cowboy hat and a worn
pair of boots you realize he is planning his next move in what canonly be a
huge game of some kind.
