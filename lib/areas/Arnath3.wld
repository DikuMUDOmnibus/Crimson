But you have heard that this is the road that leads to the Palace. There is 
supposed to be some maze of plum blossoms later on that you will have to 
solve in order to actually reach the palace, however.

that the priests of the white temple worship the creator of the world, 
otherwise known as God. They worship him because they believe that when it is 
time for the world to end, he will come back and reward those who are good and
punish those who have been evil. They do not believe that God has much to do 
with the petty problems that mortals have to face from day to day.  They do 
believe that they, as followers of God, should do all they must to help the 
poor and wretched live somewhat easier lives. They don't have much to do here 
since most of the people in northern Arnath is rich, but they do help refugees
from other cities and towns get settled in Arnath.
