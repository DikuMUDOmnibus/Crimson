Due to a careless spell of mine, i have opened an unstable portal in the
room under your feet, it has been spitting out monsters for awhile so.....
I think you can enter it without harm being done to you but i dont know
where it will lead you. please be careful. There is a key here to the
door, if you need it, just take it and unlock the door then drop it for
another to use, thank you.

Hey all! The zone below you (The Underworld) is closed right now, as i have to
still make some more rooms, mobs and objects. If you are below level 30 you
should stay away because this is one hard zone! I'll tell you guys when The
Underworld is done and I hope you all like The Land Of Cows!
Oh, you have to recall now, you cant go back through the portal so you are
confined to the wiz's council, Cya!
