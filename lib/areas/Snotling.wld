Inside the Snotling Army Camp~
Everywhere you looks there are lots of small green Snotling,but nowhere are
there as many as here. To the west is the cook's tent, and so this is where 
Snotlings spend there day.

Inside the Snotling Army Camp~
Everywhere you look you can see lots of small green Snotlings, walking lazily
around the camp.There seem to be more of them here, and suddenly you realise
why.....the big tent south of you with smoke coming out of the top is the 
cook's tent.

Inside the Snotling Army Camp~
There are a lot of Snotlings here, probably because you are so near to the
chef's tent. To the north is a large, fairly impressive looking tent, which
looks far better constructed than any of the others. There are big posts
either side of the door too, making the entrance easy to walk through. This
looks like it is where the captain of the army lives.

Before the Snotling Army Camp~
You are standing at the end of a rather unsafe looking bridge across a trench
that seems to surround the camp. There is a gate here to stop intruders,but
it looks as if you could kick it down without scuffing your boots. There is a
fence spanning away from you in both directions,but it does not look any
tougher than the gate.

The Snotling Shamen's Tent~
This tent is much larger than the others.It has an area in the centre with a
fire and a big pot of boiling water suspended over it. There are all sorts of
arcane looking objects littered around the tent, but an even larger quantity
of junk.

The Snotling Chef's Tent~
This is clearly where all of the food for the camp is prepared. There are
assorted cooking tools lying around on the ground, and there is a large 
cooking pot with some kind of stew bubbling over in it. The smell is awful,
the taste taking the back off of your throat. Obviously the chef is trying
to find out how resilient the recipients of his culinary talents truly are...

This tent looks a lot more impressive than the others,but it is still 
laughable. There are tatty shields hung on the walls,and there is a table in
the centre, with a big map on it. The map appears to be the captains plans
against Midgaard.
