[1;33mRentals[1;31m [21 March][0;37m:
      To solve to expensive rent problem and to balance the game, only CARRIED
      items will be charged.  Equipped items are free.  (So you should not be
      able to wear or hold any container type items).	
      Note that: the base cost is now level dependent too.
