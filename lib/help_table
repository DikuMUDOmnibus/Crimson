RULES
last updated: 09/02/95

We the Administrators here at CrimsonMud want everyone to have a good time and
get everything possible out of their Mud experince.

Any rule infraction on this Mud will be dealt with if it is witnessed by a
God or if it is provable by logs or other means.  A punishment can range from
loss of items or gold to loss of levels and/or your entire character.

We hope that these measures will not be needed.  As it has been discussed,
we want to foster an environment here that doesnt need constant babysitting.
Please try to treat others and the game with respect and we will not need to
punish anyone.   

If something seems like it might be stretching the rules...dont do it, even if
it is not expressly stated in the rules that it is 'illegal'.  If people are
not constantly 'stretching the rules' we can focus on other things to make the
the Mud a better place.  Treat these rules as a guideline and we will all be
fine.
   
* Player Killing IS legal on Crimson mud but there are some limits to this:
  - Killing newbies (level 1 - 3) is illegal.
  - Avatars may NOT kill mortal players.
  - Avatars may kill other Avatars in the Avatar arena.  No other room may
    be used for this.

* Player Stealing is also legal here at Crimson mud.

* Killing a mob that another player has charmed is discouraged.

* Summoning aggressive mobs to Midgaard is illegal. (try to imagine how you 
  would feel after a 5 hour marathon which raised your character to the 
  pinnacle of 10th level, only to be killed just outside the inn by Gargath,
  Lord of Tarterus....)

* Summoning an aggressive mob to other players or other players to aggressive
  mobs is illegal.

* Killing any of the Midgaard shopkeepers, the receptionist, the guildmasters
  or the temple high priest is illegal.

* Stealing other players 'kills' is illegal.  If another player is fighting a
  mob DON'T kill the mob.  Also if someone is in a room with a mob ask if it's
  their mob before killing it.  

* Looting another player's corpse is illegal unless you are asked to help by
  the recently deceased.

Once again we are trying to make this MUD a fun place to be for everyone.  If
we get too many complaints about Pkilling or Pstealing, we will discontinue
the practice.  If we all try to get along as much as possible and resect each
others right to play more or less hassle free, then this place will run 
smoothly.

LOOTING
Looting of other players corpses when they die is against the MUD rules.
If caught, your character will be punished.

Looting of equipment and cash off mobs that someone else kills is also
against the rules and will be treated as listed above.

DEATH-TRAP

Death traps are a special type of rooms.  When a player hits a death trap, 
he/she will lose ALL equipment, but NOT coins or experience points.

The best way to avoid hitting one is to look towards the direction before 
you move and read the room description carefully, as these descriptions 
often contain messages warning you about the danger, if there is a death
trap present.
#
IMMORTAL

METH (level 42)
The Methuselah (Meth) is the first level of true God on Auggiemud.  They
are the first liason between the players and the other Gods as well.  A
meth should be the first one approached if there is a problem on the Mud. 
If he or she cannot fix the problem, they will notify someone who can. 
Please, the Meths are here to help, contact them if you have a problem!

TO BE PROMOTED TO METH:

Once you reach the level of Avatar, you will have the ability to REQUEST a
promotion to Methuselah.  You can do so by contacting an Overlord (Vial
the chain of command). If they feel that you can be trusted with the immortal
position, then you will be promoted to level 42.  Any past actions, such as 
cheating or excessive pkilling will be taken into account at this time.

ANTE (level 43)
They are the next step if the METH who's around can't get a dispute settled.
They also are they to enforce the rules.  They are allowed to reimburse
equipment if there is a MUD crash and someone loses something.

HIGH (level 44)
High Gods are second in command to the Overlords.  Their word is law and
should be treated accordingly.  Most of the Highs will have specific jobs
or specific Overlords to be assisting.

IMM_RULES
These rules are for players of level 42 and higher. Avatars have their own.
         1. Do not kill mortals. And dont think that transferring
            or summoning them to aggressive mobs don't count.
         2. Do not CHEAT FOR ANY MORTAL IN ANY WAY. Unless you
            LIKE deletion. YES this does includes tanking, healing,
            restoring, casting protection on them and yes softening
            up mobs does count.
         3. Do not use transfer or summon to move mortals to mobs or
            mobs to mortals. After all they do have legs. Let them
            walk or run.
         4. Do not move or kill ANY mob for any reason.
         5. Do not give out free equipment. Only level 44 or 45 imms

ZONELORD
Zonelords are people who are creating new zones for the mud.  They have been 
granted special privileges in one zone so they can build there.  On the rest 
of the MUD they are normal characters of their level.

Restrictions:
Zonelords may NOT adventure in their zone for any reason after their zone
becomes available for the general public.  This includes ALL characters owned
by the player with the zonelord.

The zonelord and all his other chracters also may not use equipment from his
zone even if someone else goes to the zone to get it.

Once the zone has been play tested and all the bugs worked out the zonelord
will be returned to the status of a normal player.  One week after the removal
of his powers in the zone the above restrictions will be lifted from him and
he may adventure and get equipment from his zone.

Zonelords may NOT create items or mobiles for own benefits.

ROOM_GUIDES
                         Guidelines for Creating Rooms
                         -----------------------------
 
- When using rname, put the @ directly after the last character you type, 
  in order to eliminate any extra spaces in the room description.
 
- Room names have title format, i.e. Use A Small Path in the Forest
  instead of A small path in the forest.  No period is necessary at the 
  end of the name.
  
- When using rdesc, always put a return before adding the @ symbol so 
  that the description is separated from everything else in the room.
 
- To be consistent with other rooms of the game, don't indent the room
  desc too.
 
- When making death rooms in your zone, please put a hint in the rlink 
  description goin to that room. That way experienced players can look 
  in the directions they wish go when exploring your zone, and avoid the 
  dts.
  
- The rflag !TUNNEL is used for fast healing room, temporarily.

MOB_GUIDES
                      Guidelines for Creating Mobiles
                      -------------------------------
 
MOB Level Modifier
breath attack     +2
magic immunity    +2
sanctuary         +2
spell casters     +2
magic resist      +1
regeneration      +0.5
poison            +0.5
 
Meaning: Say you create a mob with level 20 stats(ac,hp,thac0,damage),
         and with Sanctuary flag, then the mob's level should be 22, with
         coins and xp for level 22.
         So a level 40 mob with sanc and mage or priest (spell casters)
         will have level 36 stats.
         Maximum modifier cannot exceed +4, i.e. a level 20 mob with all the
         above flags set will have level 16 stats.

is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you will inflict

unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence. If you miss you loose
your balance and fall.
A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.
Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5*damage.

Fighters See also : Rescue, Kick
#
RESCUE
Fighters Only.
A rescue is an attempt to make a monster hit you instead of the person being
rescued. You can only 'turn' one monster for each attempt. This is highly
useable when playing in groups.
#
STEAL
Thief only skill.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires at least 1,250 XP
points to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters
at all levels.

Example:
  steal gold drunk
  steal sword mercenary (only possible if he is sleeping)
#
BACKSTAB
Thief only.

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place you dagger in his
bag, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful backstab

20-24		6
25-29		7
30-34		8
35-39		9

persons.

#
SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

fighting unequaled by the members of any other class. However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.
   You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

#
DRAGON_KIN
Dragon Kin resemble Dragons in many ways.  They have wings, dragon shaped 
heads with horns, tails, etc...  As such they have trouble wearing equipment 
designed to be worn by humans.  As a dragon kin you will not be able to wear 
most armor, helms, and legwear that is a form of pants.  It's not that we're 
trying to deny you equipment like the only imp__invis items, etc..  It's 
just that a dragon in pants would look really strange.  There will be items 
on the mud designed so dragon kin can wear them, armor, helms, etc.  and if 
the only way to get something like Imp_invis is on an item dragon kin can't 
use we'll try to add some piece of eq with that power that you can wear.
 
Dragon Kin do have powers other characters cant' get to make up for the loss 
in equipment.  you get more hit points than other fighters, you heal faster, 
and you have the feared breath attacks.

PRACTICE PRACTISE
Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to
your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.
If you type practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and
how good you already are at these.
You can then use practice <skill>, to practice the appropriate skill.
You can only practise a certain amount for each level you gain, and you
do not have to save this, it can be accumulated.
#
EXITS
Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course, the less
obvious ones won't show up here - you have to THINK in order to locate those.
#
LEAVE
If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.

See also: ENTER
#
ENTER
If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you'll enter any nearby shelter.
You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for example, 'enter window'.

See also: LEAVE
#
TIME
Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the output of this
command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it. You'll have to, at
any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular notion
of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#
BUG TYPO IDEA
For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. 

Examples:
     bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'
     idea make a restaurant in Midgaard
     typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'
#
QUIT
When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'. Note
that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is simply left on the
ground. If you wish to have your equipment put away until you are able to come
back, you'll have to find an inn.

See also: INN
#
INNS
Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you may use inns to store your
gathered equipment while you are not playing the game (we all have to sleep
sometimes, there is no shame in that).

See also: OFFER, RENT
#
OFFER RENT
For use in the receptions of inns. The command 'offer' will make the innkeeper
tell you the cost of storing your carried items for one day. 'rent' will store
the items and make you leave the game. The next time you enter, you'll start
out in the reception where you left. The inn will store your items as long as
you have the gold to pay the rent.

See also: INN
#
GET TAKE
If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick it
up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if you just feel very
greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use 'get' to extract objects from
containers. Example: "get dagger from bag".

See also: DROP PUT
#
PUT
For putting stuff in containers. Example: "Put the dagger in the bag".

See also: GET
#
EXAMINE
May give you some valuable information about an item.

See also: LOOK
#
WRITE
In order to write a note, you need a piece of blank paper (or similar), and
a pen of some sort. You can then type something like "write on the paper with
the pen", whereupon you'll be asked to type in your note at the keyboard.
#
NEWS
This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD Herald", a
publication dedicated to news and useful information about this world. It's a
very good idea to check it out once in a while.
#
SLEEPING WAKE REST SIT STAND
For changing your position. If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea to sit
and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.
#
POUR
If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another.

Example:
pour barrel out: empties the barrel
pour fountain barrel: fill barrel with water from fountain
#
GRAB
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE
#
FOLLOW
If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why not simply
follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are following someone
and you wish to stop doing that, then all you've got to do is follow yourself:
"follow <your name>".
#
FLEE
If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto! you are out of harm's way
- that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't simply
bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?
#
GUILD
The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTICE
#
INFO
Gives you some useful hints and information about the game.
Type INFO <return> to read it.
#
WHERE
Tells you the location of a monster, a player or an object. Examples:

where torch
where dragon

Mortals can only "where" monsters or players, and only from their own zone.

Immortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where everybody is.
#
USERS
Immortal only command.
Tells you who's logged on to the game, and where they are playing from.
#
LEVELS
Lists the levels of your class. 
#
BRIEF
Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of the
room you are in; only the name of the room, the exits, and the people and 
objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with the area in which you 
travel, however, it is not advisable to use this command. Frequently, you will
find small, but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at
your surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

#
!
Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

#
CONSIDER
Usage : consider <monster>
This command will compare your Level with the <monsters> level. You will then
receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact. 
Consider does not take hitpoints/special attacks/damage/mob file typos into 
accout.  So mobiles with any special skills/spells/breaths are generally a lot
harder.  This is especially true for higher level mobiles.

Example:
  consider fido

#
EXPERIENCE XP
Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

Some of us discourage killing of other players.  Some of us may take action.
The choice is yours.  Can you take a group of high levelers?

See also: GROUP
#
GROUP
Usage : GROUP [player]

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equaly by level among the group. Experience points will only be 
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of the
killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:
Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

#
QUAFF POTION POTIONS
Use : Quaff <Potion>

#
RECITE SCROLL SCROLLS
Use : Recite <Scroll> [Target]

Is used to "read" a magical scroll. Target can be an object, character or
nothing (which may be yourself).
#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS
Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, execpt yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

Immortal only command.
If used on a mortal, this command will reset that players mana and hit points.
If used on an Immortal various values will be reset to their proper values.
#
LINK
A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your healt in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

HOUSES
Player Houses in DikuMUD
------------------------

In DikuMUD it is possible for players on all experience levels to buy a house
in the residential area in the southern part of Midgaard.

As some areas are more sought after than others, the prices vary quite a bit
The base price of a house with one room and an ordinary lock is as follows:

                   House on Emerald Avenue :  50,000,000 coins
                   House on Park Road      :  50,000,000 coins
                   House on Elm Street     :  50,000,000 coins

         The following objects can be purchased for an extra price:

                        Pick-proof lock:       10,000,000
                        Interdimensional Gate: 50,000,000
                                (gates are more for special cases)
                        Other suggestions will be taken into consideration.

AREAGUIDE
note for area designers:
- read flags.txt, database.doc and dbsup.doc for starters
- Then get a hold of the area_guide.doc &  the world editor
- where you ask? try ftp gpx.lis.uiuc.edu anonymous of course and check for
 pub/Crimson or somesuch. If its not there yet...
- mail musumeci@gpx.lis.uiuc.edu and he'll mail 'em to you..
- or mail rhaksi@engr.uvic.ca and I'll mail 'em to ya..
- AC's start at 20 and descend towards -20 or 
 lower I spose... Thacos start at 30 and descend down from there ie
- 100 and the mob will *NEVER* miss AC depending of course, 0 is probably
 a more reasonable lower bound)
- ftp completed areas to pub/incoming

NOTE: We are *DESPERATELY* in need of Good-aligned areas for Anti-paladins and Demon Knights to go kill things in

Major/minor changes ahead...
----------------------------
* Withdraw, Balance, Deposit commands (and a banker mob) ***DONE***
* When night falls it gets dark out (except in City Sects and Indoors)
  (people carry lights) ***DONE*** 
* right now people can 'pour fountain out' might fix this sometime...
  ie allow for infinite liquid source, have to check over the code might
  do this allready for contains = -1....
* Darksight spell ***DONE***
* Purchasing PR's, increasing stats, healings, restorations...(healer mob)
* those new spells that I've defined and not yet coded...
* SolvedQuest(int n) routine, ie only get experience for solving a particular
  quest the first time.. (to whoever you're grouped with as well, s'long as
  you're all in the same room)
* new zone types and flags whenever I think of some...

COMPACT
If you have a small display you might want to use this command. It turns off
(or on) the extra newline after output to your screen.

SKILLS
The following is an example of how skills work here at Crimson. All the other
classes differ of course, but this is all I've had the time to write up...
Generally, a skill will give you a bonus of skill/10 ie slash 30 equates to
plus 3 to hit...
